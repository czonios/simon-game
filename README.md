# Simon Game

Simon web application in Javascript, HTML and CSS. Written as a project for [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org).

### About

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).

In my implementation, if the user enters an incorrect sequence, the sequence replays (unless in Strict Mode). The game is won once you reach 20 correct series of button presses.

### Features

* Material design UI.
* Strict Mode toggle button.
* Correct answers counter.
